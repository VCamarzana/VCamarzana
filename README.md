## Hello, World!

With a decade of experience at Artline Solutions, a design studio specialized in web and e-learning, I have worked on projects for major clients including Warner Bros. Consumer Products Spain, and completed graphic design and e-learning course layout jobs for BBVA, Carrefour, TelefÃ³nica, Vodafone, and others. I have also carried out tasks related to photo retouching and layout. Optimistic and curious, I have strong skills in communication, adaptability and analytical. Now freelancing, I authored, illustrated and published my own book.
